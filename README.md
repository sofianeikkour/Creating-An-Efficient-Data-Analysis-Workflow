### Part 1
**Context and Objective:**  
This project is divided into two parts. In part 1, we will be acting as a data analyst for a company that sells books for learning programming. The company has produced multiple books, and each has received many reviews. The company has provided us with a dataset and wants us to check out the sales data and see if we can extract any useful information from it. Our main objective in this first part is to figure our what books are the most profitable.

**Dataset:**

Below are the details of the dataset and the name of each column:

1. book: The book’s title.
2. review: The review of each book.
3. state: The state in which the book was sold.
4. price: The price of the book.

### Part 2
**Context and Objective:**  
For the second part of this project, the company provided us another dataset that contains data on some of its 2019 book sales, and it wants us to extract some usable knowledge from it. It launched a new program encouraging more customers to buy more books on July 1st 2019, and it wants to know if this new program was successful at increasing sales and improving review quality.

**Dataset:**
